TODO:

hide/show ic
* moving gates left and top of 0,0
* numeric gates explode into input/output gates
* (^ and vice versa)
* autoconnect when terminals dropped near each other
* way to specify the regions for ic (e.g. top, left, etc)
optimizer (truth table)
* override rather than insert as default text mode in numeric
* ctrl+wheel to zoom, wheel alone should vertical scroll
* ctrl+wheel should zoom relative to mouse position on canvas, not center.
* label for userinput/useroutput that appears on gate at all times single letter IDs on useri/o, and on ICs
* ability to select a gate and fade out all wires/gates that don't lead up to that gate (recursively back to input)
?? numeric i/o tests
* truth table "gate" user entry

utility gates:
mux/demux
jk flip/flop
