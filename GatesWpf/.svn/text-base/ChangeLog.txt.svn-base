** VERSION 1.3

Fixed clear selection on new and load, undo/redo
Undo on remove input for variable inputs restores old wire
Reducing inputs on ic now gives warning
BCD and Two's Complement support on numeric gates
Keyboard move and rotate now update wire positions
Single circuit thread and update batching changes visual performance. Hopefully for the better on large circuits.
Memory leaking improved; not yet completely fixed

** VERSION 1.2

Buffer gate
Mouse wheel zoom
Keyboard shortcuts for zooming
Keyboard shortcuts for rotation
Multiple input and, or, nor, and nand gates
Scroll on drag for connecting wires and selection box

** VERSION 1.1

IC Names now centered horizontally as well as vertically
Zoom slider is now reset after new or open
Bottom text line now context-sensitive and indicates some available commands
More sane thread handling
File association for gcg
Improved circuit timing when speed is fast (< 20 ms delay)
Oscilloscope
Clock precession calculated (more accurate now)
Copy/paste on various gates now retains data like name and value
