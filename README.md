Background
		Logic Gate Simulator is an open-source tool for experimenting with and learning about logic gates. The simulator tool was originally designed for CIS students at South Puget Sound Community College but is free for anyone to use and modify under the GPL v3.
		Logic Gate Simulator is written in C#/WPF using .NET 4
		Watch a 3 minute video demonstration
		Dave Jordan has implemented a multiplier, download am.gcg

Selected Features
		Graph circuit activity over time
		Drag-and-drop gate layout and wiring
		User created "integrated circuits" for re-use
		Viewing the activity inside ICs during simulation
		Adjustable simulation speed and zoom
		Print and export as image
		Cut/copy/paste
		Inline ICs and flatten entire circuits
		New in 1.4: A variety of visual modes: 
		including isolating partial circuits to show use, 
		hiding intermediate gates,
		and not showing different colors for true/false (useful for preparing circuits for use in documents).
